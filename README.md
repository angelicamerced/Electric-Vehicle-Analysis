### Project Overview
This project utilizes a dataset of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered with the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). By using SQL, I aim to uncover patterns and trends in the data that can promote electric vehicle adoption and enhance the overall market for clean transportation.

The goal is to clean and analyze the dataset to derive valuable insights that support data-driven decision-making.
